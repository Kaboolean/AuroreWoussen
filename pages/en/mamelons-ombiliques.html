            <h2>What is an inverted nipple?</h2>
            <p>An inverted (or umbilicated) nipple is a nipple that, instead of pointing outward, is retracted inward into the breast. This malformation, often congenital, can affect one breast or both. It is due to milk ducts (lactiferous ducts) that are too short and pull the nipple inward.</p>
            <p>This anatomical particularity can be a source of aesthetic concern, hygiene difficulties (maceration in the fold) and can compromise breastfeeding.</p>
            
            <h2>Different grades of inverted nipples</h2>
            <p>Three grades are distinguished according to the severity of invagination:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade 1 (mild):</strong> The nipple can be exteriorized manually and stays out for some time before retracting. Breastfeeding is generally possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade 2 (moderate):</strong> The nipple can be exteriorized but retracts immediately. Breastfeeding may be difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade 3 (severe):</strong> The nipple cannot be exteriorized manually. Breastfeeding is impossible without surgical correction.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Surgical treatment</h2>
            <p>Correction of inverted nipples is a simple and quick procedure performed under local anesthesia at the office or under general anesthesia depending on the case and patient preferences.</p>
            <p>The procedure lasts approximately 30 minutes per nipple and consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Releasing the milk ducts that hold the nipple</li>
                <li>Permanently exteriorizing the nipple</li>
                <li>Maintaining the nipple in position with internal sutures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A small incision is made at the base of the nipple, leaving a nearly invisible scar once healed.</p>
            
            <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
            <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will examine your nipples to evaluate the grade of invagination and determine the most suitable technique. She will explain the procedure process, postoperative course and answer all your questions.</p>
            <p>It is important to mention if you plan future breastfeeding, as some techniques may sever milk ducts and compromise breastfeeding. Dr. Woussen will adapt the technique if preserving breastfeeding is desired.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>The postoperative course is simple and minimally painful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A special dressing keeps the nipple in position for a few days</li>
                <li>Mild edema and nipple sensitivity are normal</li>
                <li>Sutures are usually absorbable</li>
                <li>Resumption of daily activities is immediate</li>
                <li>Avoid rubbing on nipples for 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The result is immediately visible and permanent in the vast majority of cases. In rare cases, partial recurrence may occur and require touch-up.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
            <p>Complications are rare for this procedure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hematoma or infection (rare)</li>
                <li>Temporary altered nipple sensation</li>
                <li>Partial recurrence of invagination (rare)</li>
                <li>Projection asymmetry between the two nipples</li>
                <li>Inability to breastfeed if ducts were severed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Correction of inverted nipples offers excellent results with permanently exteriorized, naturally shaped nipples. This simple procedure significantly improves breast aesthetics and patient self-confidence. Local hygiene is also facilitated.</p>
