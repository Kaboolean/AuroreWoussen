            <h2>What is a tummy tuck?</h2>
            <p>Abdominoplasty is a surgical procedure that reshapes the abdomen by removing excess skin and fat, and repairing stretched abdominal muscles. This procedure is particularly indicated after multiple pregnancies or significant weight loss that left an unsightly abdominal apron.</p>
            <p>Abdominoplasty restores a flat and firm belly, defined waist and harmonious silhouette.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is a tummy tuck indicated for?</h2>
            <p>Abdominoplasty is for people with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excess abdominal skin (abdominal apron)</li>
                <li>Muscle wall laxity (rectus muscle diastasis)</li>
                <li>Stretch marks located below the navel</li>
                <li>Localized fat excess resistant to diet</li>
                <li>Abdominal deformation after pregnancies or massive weight loss</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The procedure is generally performed on people whose weight has been stable for several months. It is recommended to wait until pregnancy plans are complete as a new pregnancy could compromise results.</p>
            
            <h2>Different techniques</h2>
            <p>Several techniques exist depending on the extent of corrections needed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mini-abdominoplasty:</strong> For small skin excess below the navel, without major diastasis. The scar is short and the navel is not moved.</li>
                <li><strong>Classic abdominoplasty:</strong> For significant skin excess. The scar is horizontal, going from hip to hip, hidden in underwear. The navel is repositioned.</li>
                <li><strong>Abdominoplasty with liposuction:</strong> Common combination to slim the flanks and obtain a more harmonious result.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
            <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will examine your abdomen to evaluate skin excess, abdominal muscle condition (looking for diastasis), presence of excess fat and skin quality.</p>
            <p>She will explain the technique suited to your case, expected results, scars, risks and postoperative course. Preoperative photos will be taken and a detailed quote will be provided.</p>
            <p>A preoperative blood and cardiac workup will be prescribed. Stopping smoking is imperative at least 1 month before and after the procedure.</p>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts approximately 2 to 3 hours and is performed under general anesthesia. One to two nights of hospitalization are usually required.</p>
            <p>The procedure includes several stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low horizontal incision, in the bikini area</li>
                <li>Skin undermining to the ribs</li>
                <li>Abdominal muscle repair (diastasis suture)</li>
                <li>Flank liposuction if necessary</li>
                <li>Excess skin resection</li>
                <li>Navel repositioning in its new position</li>
                <li>Drain placement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A compressive dressing and abdominal girdle are applied at the end of the procedure.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>The postoperative course requires a recovery period:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Semi-flexed position during the first days to avoid tension on the scar</li>
                <li>Drains removed after 24 to 48 hours</li>
                <li>Edema and bruising for 2 to 4 weeks</li>
                <li>Moderate to significant pain in the first days, well controlled by painkillers</li>
                <li>Wearing abdominal girdle day and night for 6 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Light activities can be resumed after 2 weeks. Return to work depends on professional activity (2 to 4 weeks). Sports should be avoided for 2 to 3 months.</p>
            <p>Scars are initially red and evolve over 12 to 18 months to become thin and white. Final result is visible after 6 months to 1 year.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
            <p>Like any surgical procedure, abdominoplasty carries risks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hematoma or seroma (fluid accumulation)</li>
                <li>Infection</li>
                <li>Skin necrosis (rare, more common in smokers)</li>
                <li>Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (prevented by appropriate measures)</li>
                <li>Widened or hypertrophic scars</li>
                <li>Asymmetry or irregularities</li>
                <li>Altered abdominal sensation (usually temporary)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail of all risks during the preoperative consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Abdominoplasty offers spectacular and lasting results. The belly is flat, waist defined, muscles tightened. Stretch marks below the navel are eliminated with excess skin. This procedure truly transforms the silhouette and considerably improves quality of life.</p>
