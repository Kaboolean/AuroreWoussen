            <h2>First Consultation</h2>
            <p>The first consultation establishes the trust relationship between the patient and the listening surgeon. Through this consultation I can identify your requests, your concerns, your expectations and your motivations.</p>
            
            <p>It's the opportunity to gather information for the medical file (history, treatments...) and to perform a clinical examination so that I can offer you one or more medical or surgical care options.</p>
            
            <p>Then I detail the procedure modalities, its advantages, disadvantages, limitations and complications.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the consultation, a complete file including an information sheet from the French Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, an informed consent as well as a detailed quote (surgeon and anesthesiologist fees, clinic fees) is given to you at the end of this first consultation if a personalized care project is considered.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Following this consultation:</strong> the decision is yours with all the information given to make your choice. A minimum reflection period of 15 days is mandatory.</p>
            
            <h2>Second Consultation</h2>
            <p>The second consultation takes place before the procedure after the mandatory reflection period.</p>
            
            <p>It's the opportunity to answer the questions that came to you after the first consultation and to refine the surgical project.</p>
            
            <p>Preoperative photographs of the surgical area (front, profile, three-quarters) are systematically taken.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the consultation, the administrative file is completed and I give you the prescriptions for before and after the surgical operation.</p>
            
            <p>An anesthesia consultation must be scheduled at least 48 hours before the procedure.</p>
            
            <h2>The Surgical Procedure</h2>
            <p>The surgery takes place at the Villette Clinic in Dunkirk or at the Flandre Clinic in Coudekerque-Branche. You are hospitalized on the morning of the procedure.</p>
            
            <p>Before entering the operating room, I make all the drawings and markings necessary for the surgery.</p>
            
            <p>Discharge is either on the same day for outpatient procedures, or on day 1 or day 2 for procedures requiring hospitalization.</p>
            
            <h2>Post-operative Follow-up</h2>
            <p>Upon discharge: your file is completed with the hospitalization report and post-operative instructions and a follow-up consultation scheduled between 4 to 15 days after the procedure.</p>
            
            <p>Post-operative follow-up is carried out by my medical office team and myself.</p>

            <h2>Follow-up Consultations</h2>
            <p>Follow-up consultations are the opportunity to see each other again, to get news from you and to discuss your other requests or concerns.</p>
            
            <p>Preoperative photographs of the surgical area (front, profile, three-quarters) are systematically taken.</p>
            
            <p>Consultations take place at 3-6 months, and at 1 year.</p>
