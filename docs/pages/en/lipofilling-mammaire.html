            <h2>What is breast lipofilling?</h2>
            <p>Breast lipofilling, also called lipomodeling or autologous fat transfer, is a natural breast augmentation technique that involves harvesting fat from areas of the body where it is in excess (abdomen, hips, thighs) and reinjecting it into the breasts to increase their volume.</p>
            <p>This technique offers a natural alternative to breast implants, with the advantage of using your own tissues. It also allows slimming the silhouette at the harvesting areas.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is breast lipofilling indicated for?</h2>
            <p>Breast lipofilling is particularly suitable for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Women wanting moderate and natural breast augmentation (about 1 cup size)</li>
                <li>Patients not wanting a foreign body (implant)</li>
                <li>Correction of breast asymmetries</li>
                <li>Improvement of breast contour and cleavage</li>
                <li>Filling hollows or irregularities after implant placement</li>
                <li>Breast reconstruction after cancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To benefit from this technique, it is necessary to have enough fat to harvest. Very thin patients may not be good candidates.</p>
            
            <h2>Procedure process</h2>
            <p>The procedure takes place in three stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fat harvesting:</strong> Fat is harvested by gentle liposuction from areas defined during consultation (abdomen, hips, thighs, saddlebags). Small incisions of a few millimeters are made.</li>
                <li><strong>Fat preparation:</strong> The harvested fat is purified and prepared according to rigorous techniques to keep only viable fat cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinjection into breasts:</strong> The purified fat is reinjected evenly into different breast planes (subcutaneous, glandular, retroglandular) using micro-cannulas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The procedure lasts approximately 2 to 3 hours and is performed under general anesthesia, usually as an outpatient.</p>
            
            <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
            <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will evaluate your breasts and potential donor areas. She will determine if you have enough fat to achieve the desired result and explain the realistic results you can expect.</p>
            <p>A mammography and/or breast ultrasound will be requested before the procedure. Preoperative photos will be taken and a detailed quote will be provided.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>The postoperative course concerns both harvesting areas and breasts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harvesting areas:</strong> Edema and bruising for 2 to 3 weeks. A compression garment should be worn for 4 weeks to optimize reshaping.</li>
                <li><strong>Breasts:</strong> Edema and breast tension for a few days. A wireless support bra is recommended for 1 month.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Daily activities can be resumed after a few days. Sports should be avoided for 4 weeks.</p>
            <p>Part of the injected fat (about 30%) will be naturally resorbed by the body in the first months. The final result is visible after 3 to 6 months. A second session may be offered if additional volume is desired.</p>
            
            <h2>Advantages of breast lipofilling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Very natural result to touch and appearance</li>
                <li>No foreign body</li>
                <li>Double benefit: breast augmentation and silhouette slimming</li>
                <li>Nearly invisible scars (a few millimeters)</li>
                <li>Permanent result once the fat has stabilized</li>
                <li>Compatible with breast monitoring (mammography, ultrasound)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Limitations and risks</h2>
            <p>Breast lipofilling has certain limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited volume increase (about 1 cup per session)</li>
                <li>Requires sufficient fat reserves</li>
                <li>Partial resorption of injected fat (final result less than immediate result)</li>
                <li>Multiple sessions may be needed to achieve desired volume</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Specific risks include: fat necrosis (fatty nodules), oil cysts, infection. These complications are rare and generally benign. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail during the consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Breast lipofilling offers a very natural result, both visually and to the touch. Breasts have a natural appearance and consistency. The result is lasting because surviving fat permanently integrates into breast tissues. The silhouette is also slimmed at harvesting areas.</p>
