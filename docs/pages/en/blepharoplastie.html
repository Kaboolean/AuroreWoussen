            <h2>What is blepharoplasty?</h2>
            <p>Blepharoplasty is a surgical procedure that corrects aging signs of the eyelids: excess skin, fat pockets (bags) and sagging. This intervention rejuvenates the eye area and provides a rested, open look.</p>
            
            <h2>Types of blepharoplasty</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Upper blepharoplasty:</strong> Removes excess skin and possible fat pockets from upper eyelids. The scar is hidden in the natural eyelid crease.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower blepharoplasty:</strong> Treats bags under the eyes by removing or repositioning fat. The scar is hidden under the lashes or inside the eyelid (transconjunctival).</li>
                <li><strong>Four-eyelid blepharoplasty:</strong> Combines upper and lower blepharoplasty in a single procedure.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
            <p>Blepharoplasty is indicated for patients with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heavy, drooping upper eyelids</li>
                <li>Bags under the eyes</li>
                <li>Excess skin giving a tired look</li>
                <li>Visual field obstruction by drooping upper eyelids</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>Upper blepharoplasty lasts about 1 hour, lower about 1h30, four-eyelid about 2 hours. It can be performed under local or general anesthesia, usually as an outpatient.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cold compresses for 48 hours</li>
                <li>Edema and bruising for 1 to 2 weeks</li>
                <li>Sutures removed after 5 to 7 days</li>
                <li>Avoid contact lenses for 2 weeks</li>
                <li>Social resumption after 8 to 15 days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scars are initially pink then become nearly invisible after 3 to 6 months.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Risks include hematoma, infection, dry eyes, asymmetry, incomplete eyelid closure (temporary) and unsatisfactory scarring. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Blepharoplasty offers very natural results with an open, rested look. Results are long-lasting (10 to 15 years for upper eyelids). This procedure significantly improves the overall facial appearance.</p>
