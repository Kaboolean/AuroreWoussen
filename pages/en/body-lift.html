            <h2>What is a body lift?</h2>
            <p>Body lift, also called circumferential dermolipectomy, is a major surgical procedure that removes excess skin and fat around the entire waist. This intervention is particularly indicated after massive weight loss (bariatric surgery, diet) that left significant skin laxity.</p>
            <p>Body lift combines abdominoplasty with back and buttock lift in a single procedure, providing a global improvement of the silhouette.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is body lift indicated for?</h2>
            <p>Body lift is indicated for patients with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Significant circumferential skin excess after massive weight loss</li>
                <li>Stable weight for at least 6 months</li>
                <li>Good general health</li>
                <li>Realistic expectations about results and scars</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts 4 to 6 hours and is performed under general anesthesia with several days of hospitalization. The scar is circular around the waist, positioned to be hidden by underwear.</p>
            <p>The procedure includes removal of excess skin from the abdomen, back and buttocks, as well as muscle tightening and possible liposuction of the flanks.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>Recovery is significant given the extent of surgery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hospitalization of 3 to 5 days</li>
                <li>Drains for several days</li>
                <li>Compression garment for 6 to 8 weeks</li>
                <li>Work stoppage of 4 to 6 weeks</li>
                <li>No sports for 2 to 3 months</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Final results are visible after 6 months to 1 year.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Risks include hematoma, seroma, infection, wound healing problems (especially in former smokers), thrombosis, asymmetry and unsightly scars. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail during consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Body lift offers dramatic results with a completely transformed silhouette. Skin excess is eliminated, waist is defined, buttocks are lifted. This procedure significantly improves quality of life and self-confidence.</p>
