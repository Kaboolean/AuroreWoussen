                <h2>What is breast reduction?</h2>
                <p>Breast reduction is a surgical procedure that reduces excess breast volume while improving their shape and position. This procedure is often performed for medical reasons (back pain, neck pain, skin problems) or aesthetic reasons (discomfort, self-consciousness, difficulty finding suitable clothes).</p>
                <p>This procedure allows you to regain breasts proportionate to your body, relieve pain related to breast weight and significantly improve your quality of life.</p>
                
                <h2>Different techniques</h2>
                <p>Several breast reduction techniques exist, adapted according to the volume to be reduced and the quality of your skin:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Anchor" or "inverted T" technique:</strong> This is the most common technique for significant reductions. It allows for significant volume reduction while reshaping the form. The scars form an anchor around the areola, vertically under the breast and horizontally in the inframammary fold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical technique:</strong> This technique, called "short scar", leaves only a scar around the areola and a vertical scar under the breast. It is suitable for moderate reductions and offers a very natural result.</li>
                    <li><strong>Periareolar technique:</strong> This technique leaves only a scar around the areola. It is reserved for very moderate reductions and breast lifts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dr. Woussen will choose the most suitable technique for your case during the preoperative consultation.</p>
                
                <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
                <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will perform a complete clinical examination of your breasts: evaluation of volume, shape, position, skin quality, search for asymmetries. She will also ask about your symptoms (pain, discomfort, skin problems).</p>
                <p>She will explain the technique suited to your case, expected results, scars, risks and postoperative course. Preoperative photos will be taken to document your initial condition.</p>
                <p>A detailed quote will be provided. Breast reduction may be covered by French social security if it meets certain medical criteria (significant volume, symptoms). Dr. Woussen will inform you of this possibility.</p>
                
                <h2>The procedure</h2>
                <p>The procedure lasts approximately 2 to 3 hours and is performed under general anesthesia. It generally requires an overnight stay for optimal monitoring.</p>
                <p>The procedure consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing the volume of the mammary gland</li>
                    <li>Reshaping the breast form</li>
                    <li>Lifting the breast and repositioning the areola</li>
                    <li>Reducing the areola size if necessary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Drains may be temporarily placed to prevent hematomas. A compressive dressing and support bra are applied at the end of the procedure.</p>
                
                <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
                <p>The postoperative course is generally well tolerated. Edema (swelling) and bruising are normal in the first days and gradually disappear.</p>
                <p>A support bra must be worn day and night for 4 to 6 weeks to maintain the new breast shape and promote healing. Sutures are usually absorbable.</p>
                <p>Daily activities can be resumed after a few days, but strenuous efforts and sports should be avoided for about 1 month. It is recommended to sleep on your back during the first weeks.</p>
                <p>Scars evolve over several months. They are red at first, then gradually fade to become discreet. Local care and massages may be recommended to optimize healing.</p>
                <p>Final results are visible after 3 to 6 months, once the edema has completely disappeared and the scars have faded.</p>
                
                <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
                <p>Like any surgical procedure, breast reduction carries risks, although rare:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hematoma or infection (rare)</li>
                    <li>Skin or areola necrosis (rare)</li>
                    <li>Altered nipple sensation (usually temporary)</li>
                    <li>Asymmetry</li>
                    <li>Hypertrophic or keloid scars (depending on your predisposition)</li>
                    <li>Breastfeeding difficulties (breastfeeding may be possible but is not guaranteed)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail of all risks during the preoperative consultation.</p>
                
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Breast reduction results are generally very satisfying. Patients regain proportionate breasts, back and neck pain is often significantly improved, and quality of life is much better.</p>
                <p>Scars, although present, are generally well accepted because they are largely offset by the benefits of the procedure.</p>
