            <h2>What is a breast lift?</h2>
            <p>A breast lift, also called mastopexy, is a surgical procedure that corrects sagging (ptosis) of the breasts by lifting them and restoring a harmonious and natural shape. This procedure repositions the nipple and areola to their ideal height and tightens the breast skin.</p>
            <p>Breast ptosis can occur following pregnancy, breastfeeding, significant weight loss, or simply with time and natural tissue aging. A breast lift restores a younger and firmer bust without necessarily changing the volume.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is a breast lift indicated for?</h2>
            <p>A breast lift is indicated for women with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sagging breasts (breast ptosis) with a nipple located below the inframammary fold</li>
                <li>Loss of volume and firmness after pregnancy or breastfeeding</li>
                <li>Sagging following significant weight loss</li>
                <li>Position asymmetry between the two breasts</li>
                <li>Stretched or overly large areolas</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you also want to increase your breast volume, Dr. Woussen can combine the breast lift with implants or breast lipofilling.</p>
            
            <h2>Different techniques</h2>
            <p>Several breast lift techniques exist, chosen based on the degree of ptosis and skin quality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Periareolar technique (Round Block):</strong> For mild ptosis. The scar is only around the areola. This technique slightly lifts the breast and reduces areola size.</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical technique:</strong> For moderate ptosis. Scars are around the areola and vertically under the breast to the inframammary fold. This technique offers good breast reshaping.</li>
                <li><strong>Inverted T technique (anchor):</strong> For significant ptosis. Scars are around the areola, vertically under the breast and horizontally in the inframammary fold. This technique allows the most complete correction.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
            <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will examine your breasts to evaluate the degree of ptosis, skin quality, nipple position and presence of asymmetries. She will discuss your expectations and explain the most suitable technique for your case.</p>
            <p>Preoperative photos will be taken. A preoperative workup including mammography and/or breast ultrasound may be requested depending on your age and history. A detailed quote will be given to you at the end of the consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts approximately 1h30 to 2h30 depending on the technique used and is performed under general anesthesia. An overnight stay is usually planned.</p>
            <p>The procedure consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Repositioning the nipple and areola to their ideal height</li>
                <li>Removing excess skin</li>
                <li>Reshaping and tightening breast tissues to create a harmonious shape</li>
                <li>Reducing areola size if necessary</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A dressing and support bra are applied at the end of the procedure.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>The postoperative course is generally straightforward. Edema and bruising may appear in the first days and gradually disappear over 2 to 3 weeks.</p>
            <p>A support bra must be worn day and night for 4 to 6 weeks. Sutures are usually absorbable. Daily activities can be resumed after a few days, but strenuous efforts and sports should be avoided for about 1 month.</p>
            <p>Scars evolve over 12 to 18 months. They are initially pink then gradually fade. Local care may be recommended to optimize healing.</p>
            <p>Final results are visible after 3 to 6 months.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
            <p>Like any surgical procedure, breast lift carries risks, although rare:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hematoma or infection (rare)</li>
                <li>Skin or areola necrosis (rare)</li>
                <li>Altered nipple sensation (usually temporary)</li>
                <li>Residual asymmetry</li>
                <li>Hypertrophic or keloid scars</li>
                <li>Recurrence of ptosis over time (related to natural aging)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail of all risks during the preoperative consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Breast lift offers very satisfying results with a lifted, firmed and harmonious bust. Patients regain a younger silhouette and better self-confidence. Results are lasting, although natural aging continues to affect the breasts over time.</p>
