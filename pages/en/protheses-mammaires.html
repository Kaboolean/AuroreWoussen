                <h2>What is breast augmentation?</h2>
                <p>Breast augmentation with implants is a surgical procedure that increases breast volume by placing breast implants. This procedure can be performed for various reasons: increasing natural breast size, restoring volume after weight loss or pregnancy, or correcting breast asymmetry.</p>
                
                <h2>Different techniques</h2>
                <p>Several breast augmentation techniques exist, each adapted to your morphology and expectations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Incision approach:</strong> The incision can be made under the breast (in the inframammary fold), around the areola (periareolar), or at the armpit (transaxillary). The choice depends on your morphology and preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implant position:</strong> The implant can be placed retromammary (behind the mammary gland) or retromuscular (behind the pectoral muscle). The retromuscular position generally offers a more natural result and reduces the risk of capsular contracture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Type of implant:</strong> Implants can be cohesive silicone gel (round or anatomical) or saline-filled. Anatomical implants offer a more natural result, while round implants provide more projection.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
                <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will evaluate your expectations, examine your morphology (size, shape, breast position, skin quality) and recommend the most suitable technique for your case. She will explain in detail the different options, potential risks, postoperative course and answer all your questions.</p>
                <p>Preoperative photos will be taken to document your initial condition and facilitate planning of the procedure. A detailed quote will be given to you at the end of the consultation.</p>
                
                <h2>The procedure</h2>
                <p>The procedure lasts approximately 1h30 and is performed under general anesthesia. It can be done as an outpatient (same-day discharge) or with an overnight stay depending on the case and your preferences.</p>
                <p>The procedure takes place in a fully equipped operating room, with all safety guarantees. After the procedure, a compressive dressing and support bra are applied.</p>
                
                <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
                <p>The postoperative course is generally straightforward. Edema (swelling) and bruising may appear in the first days but gradually disappear.</p>
                <p>A support bra must be worn day and night for 4 to 6 weeks to keep the implants in good position and promote healing. Sutures are usually absorbable and do not require removal.</p>
                <p>Daily activities can be resumed quickly (a few days), but sports and strenuous activities should be avoided for about 1 month. It is recommended to avoid arm movements above the head during the first weeks.</p>
                <p>Final results are visible after 3 to 6 months, once the edema has completely disappeared and the implants have settled into position.</p>
                
                <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
                <p>Like any surgical procedure, breast augmentation carries risks, although rare:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hematoma or infection (rare)</li>
                    <li>Capsular contracture (formation of a shell around the implant)</li>
                    <li>Implant rupture (rare with modern implants)</li>
                    <li>Asymmetry or implant displacement</li>
                    <li>Altered nipple sensation (usually temporary)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail of all risks during the preoperative consultation.</p>
