            <h2>What is otoplasty?</h2>
            <p>Otoplasty is a surgical procedure that corrects protruding ears by repositioning them closer to the head and/or reshaping ear cartilage. This intervention can be performed on children from age 7 (when ears have reached adult size) as well as on adults.</p>
            
            <h2>Ear anomalies treated</h2>
            <p>Otoplasty can correct:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protruding ears (excessively angled from the head)</li>
                <li>Lack of antihelix fold (flat ear)</li>
                <li>Overly large concha (central ear cavity)</li>
                <li>Ear asymmetry</li>
                <li>Overly large earlobes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
            <p>Otoplasty is indicated for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Children from age 7 suffering from mockery or psychological discomfort</li>
                <li>Adults embarrassed by their ear appearance</li>
                <li>Anyone with protruding or asymmetrical ears</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts 1 to 1h30 and can be performed under local anesthesia (adults) or general anesthesia (children). It is usually done as an outpatient.</p>
            <p>The technique involves reshaping cartilage through an incision behind the ear, leaving an invisible scar.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Head bandage for 1 to 2 days</li>
                <li>Headband to wear at night for 1 month</li>
                <li>Edema and discomfort for a few days</li>
                <li>No sports for 1 month</li>
                <li>School or work resumption after a few days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Final results are visible immediately but take 2 to 3 months to fully settle.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Risks include hematoma, infection, asymmetry, over- or under-correction, abnormal scarring (keloid) and altered sensitivity. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Otoplasty offers permanent results with naturally positioned, harmonious ears. This procedure has a significant positive impact on self-confidence, particularly in children. Patients can wear their hair short or pulled back with confidence.</p>
