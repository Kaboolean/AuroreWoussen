            <h2>What is a thigh lift?</h2>
            <p>Thigh lift, or cruroplasty, is a surgical procedure that removes excess skin and fat from the thighs. This procedure is indicated when thighs present significant sagging that cannot be corrected by exercise, often after massive weight loss or with aging.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
            <p>Thigh lift is indicated for patients with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excess skin on inner and/or outer thighs</li>
                <li>Significant thigh sagging after weight loss</li>
                <li>Skin rubbing causing discomfort or skin problems</li>
                <li>Stable weight and good general health</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <p>Several techniques exist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inner thigh lift:</strong> Scar in the groin fold, for moderate sagging</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical thigh lift:</strong> Vertical scar on inner thigh, for significant sagging</li>
                <li><strong>Circular thigh lift:</strong> Combined with body lift for massive weight loss patients</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts 2 to 3 hours under general anesthesia with 1 to 2 nights hospitalization.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Compression garment for 4 to 6 weeks</li>
                <li>Avoid prolonged standing for 2 weeks</li>
                <li>Work resumption after 2 to 3 weeks</li>
                <li>No sports for 6 to 8 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scars fade over 12 to 18 months.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Risks include hematoma, seroma, infection, wound healing problems, lymphedema, altered sensitivity, asymmetry and scar displacement. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Thigh lift offers very satisfying results with toned, harmonious thighs. Walking comfort is improved and patients can wear shorts or swimsuits with confidence.</p>
