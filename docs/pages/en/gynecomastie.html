            <h2>What is gynecomastia?</h2>
            <p>Gynecomastia is an excessive development of the mammary gland in men, giving a more or less marked "breast" appearance. This condition can be unilateral (one side) or bilateral (both sides) and can be a source of significant aesthetic and psychological discomfort.</p>
            <p>It is important to distinguish true gynecomastia (excess mammary gland) from adipomastia (excess fat without glandular development), as treatment differs. In many cases, both components are associated.</p>
            
            <h2>Causes of gynecomastia</h2>
            <p>Gynecomastia can have several origins:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physiological:</strong> Common at certain periods of life (newborn, puberty, elderly man) due to natural hormonal variations</li>
                <li><strong>Hormonal:</strong> Imbalance between estrogen and testosterone</li>
                <li><strong>Medication-related:</strong> Certain medications can promote gynecomastia (anti-androgens, certain antidepressants, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Pathological:</strong> Certain diseases can be the cause (testicular tumors, liver failure, hyperthyroidism, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Idiopathic:</strong> In many cases, no cause is found</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A medical workup is performed before any surgery to rule out a pathological cause requiring specific treatment.</p>
            
            <h2>Types of gynecomastia</h2>
            <p>Several types are distinguished according to the composition of excess tissues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glandular gynecomastia:</strong> Predominance of firm glandular tissue. Treatment by surgical excision of the gland.</li>
                <li><strong>Adipomastia:</strong> Predominance of fatty tissue. Treatment by liposuction.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed gynecomastia:</strong> Combination of gland and fat. Treatment combining liposuction and glandular excision.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
            <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will perform a clinical examination to determine the type of gynecomastia and its extent. She will look for a possible cause and may request additional tests (hormonal workup, breast ultrasound).</p>
            <p>She will explain the surgical technique adapted to your case, expected results, scars, risks and postoperative course. Preoperative photos will be taken and a detailed quote will be provided.</p>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts approximately 1 to 2 hours and is performed under general anesthesia, usually as an outpatient.</p>
            <p>Depending on the type of gynecomastia, the procedure may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liposuction:</strong> To remove excess fat. Small incisions of a few millimeters are made.</li>
                <li><strong>Glandular excision:</strong> To remove the mammary gland. A semi-circular incision at the lower edge of the areola allows removal of glandular tissue.</li>
                <li><strong>Skin resection:</strong> In case of significant excess skin, skin resection may be necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A compressive dressing and compression garment are applied at the end of the procedure.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>The postoperative course is generally straightforward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Edema and bruising for 2 to 3 weeks</li>
                <li>Moderate pain, well controlled by painkillers</li>
                <li>Wearing a compression garment for 4 to 6 weeks</li>
                <li>Resumption of daily activities after a few days</li>
                <li>No sports for 4 to 6 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scars are discreet: at the areola edge for glandular excision, a few millimeters for liposuction. They gradually fade over several months.</p>
            <p>The final result is visible after 3 to 6 months, once the edema has completely resolved.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
            <p>Like any surgical procedure, gynecomastia treatment carries risks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hematoma or infection (rare)</li>
                <li>Residual asymmetry</li>
                <li>Surface irregularities</li>
                <li>Altered areola sensation (usually temporary)</li>
                <li>Insufficient or excessive resection</li>
                <li>Visible scars</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail of all risks during the consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Surgical treatment of gynecomastia offers excellent results with a flat, masculine chest. This procedure allows regaining a normal silhouette and feeling comfortable shirtless. The positive psychological impact is often considerable, with a notable improvement in self-confidence.</p>
