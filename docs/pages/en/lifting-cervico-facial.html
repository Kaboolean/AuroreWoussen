            <h2>What is a facelift?</h2>
            <p>The cervico-facial lift, commonly called facelift, is a surgical procedure that corrects signs of facial and neck aging. It allows lifting sagging tissues, smoothing wrinkles and restoring a youthful, rested appearance while preserving natural facial expressions.</p>
            
            <h2>What does a facelift treat?</h2>
            <p>A facelift can correct:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sagging facial tissues (jowls)</li>
                <li>Deep nasolabial folds</li>
                <li>Marionette lines</li>
                <li>Neck laxity and "turkey neck"</li>
                <li>Double chin</li>
                <li>Loss of jaw definition</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <p>Several techniques exist adapted to the degree of aging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mini-lift:</strong> For early signs of aging, limited incisions, faster recovery</li>
                <li><strong>SMAS facelift:</strong> Classic technique lifting the muscular layer for lasting results</li>
                <li><strong>Deep plane facelift:</strong> More complete technique for significant aging</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The facelift can be combined with eyelid surgery, lipofilling or neck liposuction.</p>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts 2 to 4 hours under general anesthesia. Hospitalization is 1 to 2 nights. Incisions are hidden around the ears and in the hairline.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Dressing for 24 to 48 hours</li>
                <li>Edema and bruising for 2 to 3 weeks</li>
                <li>Sutures removed after 8 to 15 days</li>
                <li>Social resumption after 2 to 3 weeks</li>
                <li>Avoid sun exposure for 2 months</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Final results are visible after 3 to 6 months.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Risks include hematoma, infection, wound healing problems, temporary facial nerve damage (very rare), asymmetry and visible scars. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The facelift offers very natural results with a youthful, rested appearance. Results last 8 to 12 years on average. Aging continues but from a rejuvenated baseline.</p>
