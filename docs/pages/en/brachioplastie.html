            <h2>What is an arm lift?</h2>
            <p>Arm lift, or brachioplasty, is a surgical procedure that removes excess skin and fat from the upper arms. This procedure is indicated when the arms present significant sagging that cannot be corrected by exercise alone, often following massive weight loss or with aging.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
            <p>Arm lift is indicated for patients with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excess loose skin on the inner arms ("bat wings")</li>
                <li>Significant arm laxity after weight loss</li>
                <li>Arm sagging related to aging</li>
                <li>Stable weight and good general health</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <p>Several techniques exist depending on the extent of sagging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited arm lift:</strong> For moderate sagging, scar hidden in the armpit</li>
                <li><strong>Classic arm lift:</strong> For significant sagging, vertical scar on the inner arm from armpit to elbow</li>
                <li><strong>Liposuction alone:</strong> For isolated fat excess without skin laxity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts 1h30 to 2h30 under general anesthesia, usually as an outpatient or with one night hospitalization.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Compression garment for 4 weeks</li>
                <li>Avoid arm elevation for 2 weeks</li>
                <li>Work resumption after 1 to 2 weeks</li>
                <li>No sports for 6 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scars fade over 12 to 18 months.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>Risks include hematoma, infection, wound healing problems, altered sensitivity, asymmetry and visible scars. Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Arm lift offers very satisfying results with toned, harmonious arms. Patients can wear short sleeves with confidence again.</p>
