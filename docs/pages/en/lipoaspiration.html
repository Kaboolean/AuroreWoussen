            <h2>What is liposuction?</h2>
            <p>Liposuction is a surgical procedure that permanently removes localized fat deposits resistant to diet and exercise. This technique aspirates fat cells (adipocytes) using fine cannulas, allowing harmonious reshaping of the silhouette.</p>
            <p>It is important to understand that liposuction is not a weight loss method but a body contouring technique intended to treat localized fat deposits in people with stable weight.</p>
            
            <h2>Treatable areas</h2>
            <p>Liposuction can treat many body areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abdomen:</strong> Belly, flanks (love handles)</li>
                <li><strong>Hips:</strong> Saddlebags</li>
                <li><strong>Thighs:</strong> Inner and outer surface</li>
                <li><strong>Knees:</strong> Inner surface</li>
                <li><strong>Arms:</strong> Inner surface</li>
                <li><strong>Back:</strong> Bra line bulges</li>
                <li><strong>Face and neck:</strong> Double chin, jowls</li>
                <li><strong>Calves and ankles:</strong> In case of localized excess</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Multiple areas can be treated during the same procedure.</p>
            
            <h2>Preoperative consultation</h2>
            <p>During the consultation, Dr. Woussen will evaluate your skin quality, location and extent of fat deposits. She will determine if you are a good candidate for liposuction and explain the realistic results you can expect.</p>
            <p>A complete clinical examination will be performed, as well as preoperative photos. Dr. Woussen will explain the technique, postoperative course, risks and answer all your questions. A detailed quote will be provided.</p>
            <p>Liposuction is more effective in people with good skin elasticity, allowing the skin to retract after fat aspiration.</p>
            
            <h2>The procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure lasts 1 to 3 hours depending on the number of areas treated and volume to be aspirated. It can be performed under local, regional or general anesthesia depending on the extent of treatment.</p>
            <p>The technique includes several stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infiltration:</strong> A solution containing local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor is injected into areas to be treated to facilitate aspiration and reduce bleeding.</li>
                <li><strong>Aspiration:</strong> Fine cannulas (2 to 4 mm diameter) are introduced through small incisions of a few millimeters. Fat is aspirated evenly and homogeneously through back-and-forth movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Closure:</strong> Incisions are closed with stitches or left open to promote drainage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Liposuction can be performed as an outpatient or with an overnight stay depending on the volume aspirated.</p>
            
            <h2>Postoperative course</h2>
            <p>The postoperative course is marked by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Significant edema (swelling) for 2 to 4 weeks</li>
                <li>Bruising for 2 to 3 weeks</li>
                <li>Moderate pain, comparable to muscle soreness</li>
                <li>Pink fluid drainage from incisions for a few days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A compression garment (girdle, shorts) must be worn day and night for 4 to 6 weeks to promote skin retraction and limit edema.</p>
            <p>Daily activities can be resumed after a few days. Sports should be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks. Final results are visible after 3 to 6 months, once the edema has completely resolved.</p>
            
            <h2>Risks and complications</h2>
            <p>Like any surgical procedure, liposuction carries risks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hematoma or infection (rare)</li>
                <li>Surface irregularities (bumps, hollows)</li>
                <li>Asymmetry</li>
                <li>Temporary skin hyperpigmentation</li>
                <li>Altered sensation (usually temporary)</li>
                <li>Skin laxity if skin lacks elasticity</li>
                <li>Fat embolism (exceptional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dr. Woussen will inform you in detail of all risks during the preoperative consultation.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Liposuction offers permanent results because removed fat cells do not regenerate. The silhouette is slimmed and harmoniously reshaped. To maintain results, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle (balanced diet, regular physical activity).</p>
            <p>In case of significant weight gain, fat may deposit in other untreated areas.</p>
