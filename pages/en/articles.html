                    <p>Breast surgery is one of the most requested procedures in cosmetic surgery. Whether it's an augmentation, reduction or breast lift, good preparation is essential to optimize results and facilitate recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Before the procedure</h3>
                    <p>The preoperative consultation is a crucial step. It allows establishing a dialogue with your surgeon, defining your expectations and understanding the different options available to you. Don't hesitate to ask all your questions during this appointment.</p>

                    <p>It is recommended to stop smoking at least one month before the procedure, as smoking can compromise healing and increase the risk of complications.</p>

                    <h3>Preoperative examinations</h3>
                    <p>Your surgeon will prescribe a blood test and possibly a mammogram depending on your age and history. These examinations ensure that you are in good health to undergo the procedure.</p>

                    <h3>The big day</h3>
                    <p>Come fasting, without makeup or nail polish. Bring loose and comfortable clothes, especially a top that opens at the front to make dressing easier after the operation.</p>

                    <p>Mental preparation is just as important as physical preparation. Keep confidence in your surgeon and your decision.</p>

                    <p>Liposuction has evolved considerably in recent years thanks to technological advances. These new techniques allow for more precise results while reducing recovery times.</p>

                    <h3>Power-assisted liposuction (PAL)</h3>
                    <p>This technique uses a vibrating cannula that facilitates the fragmentation of fat cells. It allows for gentler and more uniform aspiration, thus reducing tissue trauma.</p>

                    <h3>Ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL)</h3>
                    <p>Ultrasound liquefies the fat before aspiration, which makes the procedure less traumatic for surrounding tissues. This technique is particularly effective for treating fibrous areas.</p>

                    <h3>Fat transfer: using the aspirated fat</h3>
                    <p>A major trend is the reuse of aspirated fat to fill other areas of the body. This natural technique allows for breast, buttock augmentation or facial rejuvenation without implants.</p>

                    <p>These advances now make it possible to offer tailor-made procedures, adapted to each patient and their aesthetic goals.</p>

                    <p>The cervico-facial lift is a procedure that corrects signs of aging on the face and neck. But when is it wise to consider this surgery?</p>

                    <h3>Signs that may motivate a facelift</h3>
                    <p>Sagging facial tissues, appearance of jowls, neck laxity and accentuation of nasolabial folds are all signs that may lead you to consult.</p>

                    <h3>The ideal age: an individual question</h3>
                    <p>There is no universal ideal age for a facelift. Skin aging depends on many factors: genetics, sun exposure, smoking, lifestyle. Some patients consult as early as 45, others wait until their sixties.</p>

                    <h3>Alternatives to surgical facelift</h3>
                    <p>Before considering surgery, aesthetic medicine can offer interesting solutions: hyaluronic acid injections, thread lifts, or radiofrequency treatments. These techniques help delay the need for surgery.</p>

                    <p>The decision must be made in consultation with your surgeon, who will advise you on the best approach for your situation.</p>

                    <p>After one or more pregnancies, many women find that their belly doesn't return to its original appearance despite exercise and a balanced diet. A tummy tuck can then be an effective solution.</p>

                    <h3>What is a tummy tuck?</h3>
                    <p>Abdominoplasty, or tummy tuck, is a surgical procedure that aims to remove excess skin and fat from the abdomen while tightening the abdominal wall muscles.</p>

                    <h3>Post-pregnancy issues treated</h3>
                    <p>This procedure corrects diastasis (separation of the rectus muscles), removes the abdominal apron, reduces stretch marks below the navel and restores a harmonious silhouette.</p>

                    <h3>When to consider the procedure?</h3>
                    <p>It is recommended to wait at least one year after childbirth and to have a stable weight. If you are planning more pregnancies, it is preferable to wait as a new pregnancy could compromise the results.</p>

                    <p>Abdominoplasty can be combined with liposuction to optimize results and sculpt the overall silhouette.</p>

                    <h2 class="articles-page__article-title">Aesthetic medicine vs surgery: how to choose?</h2>

                    <p>Faced with the many options available today to improve your appearance, it's not always easy to know which solution to turn to. Aesthetic medicine or surgery? Here are some keys to help you make the right choice.</p>

                    <h3>Aesthetic medicine: subtle and reversible results</h3>
                    <p>Hyaluronic acid injections, botulinum toxin, peels or laser treatments allow for natural results without surgery. These treatments are generally reversible and require regular touch-ups.</p>

                    <h3>Cosmetic surgery: lasting results</h3>
                    <p>When skin sagging is too significant or volumes to correct are substantial, surgery becomes the most suitable solution. Results are lasting and more pronounced.</p>

                    <h3>A complementary approach</h3>
                    <p>In many cases, aesthetic medicine and surgery are complementary. Aesthetic medicine can prepare or maintain the results of surgery, or delay a procedure.</p>

                    <p>The choice depends on your expectations, your age, the condition of your skin and your availability for recovery. A personalized consultation will help you define the best strategy.</p>
